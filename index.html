    - i loved this piece so much!!!!<br><br>
    ✩ <a>“so much convenience, but so little comfort”</a><br>
    ✩ <a>“technology has transformed from a tool that we use to a place where we live”</a><br><br>

<u>place 1: nypl</u><br>
some people are unnerved to visit the library because it doesn’t require a transaction from you.<br>
<u>place 2: penn station</u><br>
original design/architecture of penn station reminded me a lot of the arcades described in walter benjamin’s work. <br>
- as someone who grew up on long island and has spent a great deal of time commuting through penn station, i found chimero's description to be really funny and accurate. i've been meaning to go check out the redesign on the station. <br><br>

- the room sets the tone for what kind of thoughts and actions take place in it. <br>
- commercial v non-commercial needs.<br><br>

some things that really struck me about this reading were the analogy made about the rooms, and the idea that we're more affected by the personal choices we make on the web than what the technology industry pushes on us. i also agree with the author's point that any platform with such a huge user base as facebook shouldn't be able to be privatized. that seems to lend itself to further data insecurity, since you're putting your information of the hands of people who are not required to even consider your best interests or safety. <br><br>

✩ <a>“what’s missing is the spiritual meaning of technology” <br>-kevin kelley</a> <br>
this struck a chord with me………i’ll be thinking about this quote for a long time.<br><br>
<img src="memling.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

the topic of mass surveillane has also been introduced this week. this issue is something that has stuck with me since viewing citizen four and engaging in class discussions about the principle of “linkability” in today’s society. an example of this would be how you can now ride the subway using your phone instead of with a physical card, allowing higher ups to track your specific movements throughout the city.

    <a href="https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/">the internet didn’t kill counterculture—you just won’t find it on instagram</a> by caroline busta<br>
    - really into the idea of betraying your online self <br>
    <a>GAFA=Google/Apple/Facebook/Amazon</a><br>
    “artists (like the psychedelic hippies of yore) were being literally countercultural—using culture against itself to violate the hegemonic push toward, in allin’s and rice’s case, neoliberal ‘responsibilization.’”<br>
    “e-deologies, radical politics as a form of niche personal branding.”<br>
    - competitive futurist vs countercultural<br>
    - the internet encourages you to express yourself with your real identity, but then will hold you accountable to whatever you say and do<br>
    - dark web vs the “dark forrest”<br><br>
    in order to really be a part of counter culture online, you have to have power— wether that be through access, data, etc. it’s also important to remain anonymous. we see a trend now of people not identifying with political parties, and having more interest in dismantling existing systems and constructing a new ‘infrastructure’ <br>

    - people believe in the longevity of the web more than they believe in the legitimacy of its information<br>
    - websites aren’t designed to last forever, information on social media “dies” with its host<br>
    - i had never really thought about how the ever-changing nature of the web can make things like legal proceedings more difficult.<br>
    - really interesting connection to the library of alexandria<br>
    - version control— seems to be the most effective way of archiving web pages<br>
    - relationship between material and digital archives<br>

    <h1>week 2</h1>paul chan's <a href="https://4columns.org/chan-paul/letter-to-young-artists-during-a-global-pandemic">letter to young artists during a global pandemic</a> brought up some really interesting concepts. here are some of my favorite quotes:<br>
    <br>
    1. “is there a direction home that doesn’t point backwards?”<br>
    2. "Trouble is what you find and what you must endure if you wish to gain an identity."<br>
    3. “'the origin is the goal' can be read as a motto for what kraus believed was the proper goal for any endeavor, cultural or otherwise: to return to a glorious bygone past. the goal is now not to go back to a past. the goal is to find or discover what is new."<br>
    <br>
    i found paul's words to be both uncomfortable and conforting. it's a little bit unsettling to think about how you can't go home or find home without regressing in some way. i definitely felt that way during this pandemic when i moved back home for several months. although, i like paul, am in no position to complain, moving back home made me feel like i was moving backwards in terms of my progression as a young adult. however, i really liked when paul discussed the multiple meanings of the word origin. this transformed the meaning of his and kraus' words to indicate that the goal is not to regress, but to discover new things. i think this is applicable to both life and art.
