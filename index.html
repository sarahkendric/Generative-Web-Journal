<u>concepts found in games:<br></u>
1. control<br>
2. interactions<br>
3. transformation<br><br>

i thought it was interesting how the rules of the game were outlined in such great detail. it reminds me of art that’s “generated” in a sense through sets of instructions. the work of sol lewitt comes to mind as an example of artworks that can be replicated by anyone (or by a gallery) given they follow his instructions. The use of the terms “constants” and “variables” were also interesting to link back to words used in programming languages. finally, i was struck by the suggestion to conduct a discussion following the game to analyze the players’ understanding of it. this seems like a pretty straightforward and successful way to experiment further with the games outlined in this reading.

    <a>GUI or gooey = graphical user interface</a><br>
it's not at all surprising to read that much of siicon valley is a hub for liberal whiteness. it's disappointing because so many foundational principles of the web can be attributed to women and people of color. Black erasure in tech fields definitely seems to be a long standing issue. <br><br>
<u>gooey universe</u><br>
- gooey consolidated interface methods into easily understandable iconography <br>
- i really like interface metaphors, this also reminds me of

<a href="https://theculturejournalist.substack.com/p/is-counterculture-still-possible" target="_blank">is counterculture still possible? by the culture journalist</a><br>
- i really enjoyed the piece we initially read by busta, so i was excited to hear her on this podcast as well. <br>
- idea of counter culture being associated with an aesthetic that's "cool" and "valuable." anti-corporate, anti-mainstream.<br>
- the idea of counter culture being anti-corporate makes me think about how certain brands now will put out campaigns or various messaging supporting the BLM movement. this comes off as disingenuous most of the time because verbalizing the sentiment doesn't matter or do anything for the cause if the company isn't upholding those values at every level. <br>
- i also enjoyed how they further discussed this duality in places, specifically st. marks. can a place be considered countercultural if consumerism is taking place within it?
- who benefits from counterculture movements that take place on social media?

    <a href="https://theusercondition.computer">the user condition: computer agency and behavior</a> by silvio lorusso<br>
    asking the question of what is required for a user to have autonomy when using a computer made of software programmed by somebody else, how much agency the user has <br><br>
✩ mcneil: “ss smartphones blurred organizational boundaries of online and offline worlds, spatial metaphors lost favor. How could we talk about the internet as a place when we’re checking it on the go, with mobile hardware offering turn-by-turn directions form a car cup holder or stuffed in a jacket pocket?”<br><br>
✩ “one of the main software dichotomies is that of the user versus the programmer, the latter being the one who acts and the former being the one who’s acted upon”<br><br>
this piece made me question how much agency i really have in my day to day life— feel like my generation was one of the first to grow up with computers and smartphones, it’s so engrained into my reality. if i had to guess how one could break out of the pattern of being a user i would guess that its by altering the web in some way and having the technical skills to change the content you’re viewing/how you’re viewing it. AI is also discussed in the article, this feels like a way for the user to have agency (to a degree, of course) in a digital “reality." i was also introduced to the concept of <a>hyper-linearity</a> in this article, i think this is a good thing to think about with my project and how i can break out of that format

    <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/awiiggfvchzhq75/14_galloway_jodis-infrastructure.pdf?dl=0">jodi’s infrastructure</a> by alexander galloway<br>
    “do you think of yourself as primarily working ‘on’ the digital or primarily ‘within’ it?”<br><br>
    - working on the digital is using the digital as an object, and when working within it the ‘perspective’ of the digital context is more carefully considered. <br>
    - does art orient towards the digital, or does it just live inside the digital?<br><br>
    this article posed lots of great questions about the relationship between the medium and the art, especially in digital formats. ot discussed content vs context, using the quote “the medium is the message” to explain a modern perspective on digital art. the author also discusses where work resides on the web: in the screen/browser and in the very infrastructure of the web (server software, HTML, etc). This question of where digital art resides calls to mind the question of ownership over digital art. i’ve been reading recently about NFT, which is basically a way to buy and sell digital art through a database. instead of buying a painting to hang in your living room, you own a “unique digital representation of it” that exists only within the database. i think these are all really interesting concepts when talking about modern digital art.

    - i loved this piece so much!!!!<br><br>
    ✩ <a>“so much convenience, but so little comfort”</a><br>
    ✩ <a>“technology has transformed from a tool that we use to a place where we live”</a><br><br>

<u>place 1: nypl</u><br>
some people are unnerved to visit the library because it doesn’t require a transaction from you.<br>
<u>place 2: penn station</u><br>
original design/architecture of penn station reminded me a lot of the arcades described in walter benjamin’s work. <br>
- as someone who grew up on long island and has spent a great deal of time commuting through penn station, i found chimero's description to be really funny and accurate. i've been meaning to go check out the redesign on the station. <br><br>
<img src="penn.jpg" width="300px"><img src="arcades.jpg" width="300px"><br>

- the room sets the tone for what kind of thoughts and actions take place in it. <br>
- commercial v non-commercial needs.<br><br>

some things that really struck me about this reading were the analogy made about the rooms, and the idea that we're more affected by the personal choices we make on the web than what the technology industry pushes on us. i also agree with the author's point that any platform with such a huge user base as facebook shouldn't be able to be privatized. that seems to lend itself to further data insecurity, since you're putting your information of the hands of people who are not required to even consider your best interests or safety. <br><br>

✩ <a>“what’s missing is the spiritual meaning of technology” <br>-kevin kelley</a> <br>
this struck a chord with me………i’ll be thinking about this quote for a long time.<br><br>
<img src="memling.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>

the topic of mass surveillane has also been introduced this week. this issue is something that has stuck with me since viewing citizen four and engaging in class discussions about the principle of “linkability” in today’s society. an example of this would be how you can now ride the subway using your phone instead of with a physical card, allowing higher ups to track your specific movements throughout the city.

    - really into the idea of betraying your online self <br>
    <a>GAFA=Google/Apple/Facebook/Amazon</a><br>
    “artists (like the psychedelic hippies of yore) were being literally countercultural—using culture against itself to violate the hegemonic push toward, in allin’s and rice’s case, neoliberal ‘responsibilization.’”<br>
    “e-deologies, radical politics as a form of niche personal branding.”<br>
    - competitive futurist vs countercultural<br>
    - the internet encourages you to express yourself with your real identity, but then will hold you accountable to whatever you say and do<br>
    - dark web vs the “dark forrest”<br><br>
    in order to really be a part of counter culture online, you have to have power— wether that be through access, data, etc. it’s also important to remain anonymous. we see a trend now of people not identifying with political parties, and having more interest in dismantling existing systems and constructing a new ‘infrastructure’ <br>

    - people believe in the longevity of the web more than they believe in the legitimacy of its information<br>
    - websites aren’t designed to last forever, information on social media “dies” with its host<br>
    - i had never really thought about how the ever-changing nature of the web can make things like legal proceedings more difficult.<br>
    - really interesting connection to the library of alexandria<br>
    - version control— seems to be the most effective way of archiving web pages<br>

    <h1>week 2</h1>paul chan's <a href="https://4columns.org/chan-paul/letter-to-young-artists-during-a-global-pandemic">letter to young artists during a global pandemic</a> brought up some really interesting concepts. here are some of my favorite quotes:<br>
    <br>
    1. “is there a direction home that doesn’t point backwards?”<br>
    2. "Trouble is what you find and what you must endure if you wish to gain an identity."<br>
    3. “'the origin is the goal' can be read as a motto for what kraus believed was the proper goal for any endeavor, cultural or otherwise: to return to a glorious bygone past. the goal is now not to go back to a past. the goal is to find or discover what is new."<br>
    <br>
    i found paul's words to be both uncomfortable and conforting. it's a little bit unsettling to think about how you can't go home or find home without regressing in some way. i definitely felt that way during this pandemic when i moved back home for several months. although, i like paul, am in no position to complain, moving back home made me feel like i was moving backwards in terms of my progression as a young adult. however, i really liked when paul discussed the multiple meanings of the word origin. this transformed the meaning of his and kraus' words to indicate that the goal is not to regress, but to discover new things. i think this is applicable to both life and art.
